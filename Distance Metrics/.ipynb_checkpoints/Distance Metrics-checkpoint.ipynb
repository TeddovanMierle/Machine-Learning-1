Alternative investments are perceived to behave differently from traditional investments. Investors may seek either absolute return or relative return.\n",

Some investors in alternative investments have a relative return objective. A relative return objective, which is often the objective of portfolios of traditional investment, seeks to achieve a return relative to an equity or a fixed-income benchmark.\n",
